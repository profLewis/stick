# Sensor Configuration
# --------------------
# Map each sensor to a sound file (WAV filename without .wav).
#
# Two modes:
#
# Direct GPIO (sensors wired directly to Pico pins):
#   gpio  pin_number  sound
#   D0 is active-HIGH. Needs pull-down resistor (~10K) between D0 and GND.
#
# TCA9548A hub (sensors via I2C mux):
#   hub_addr  channel  pin  sound
#   hub_addr: TCA9548A I2C address (0x70, 0x71, etc.)
#   channel:  0-7 (TCA9548A channel)
#   pin:      A = SDA wire, B = SCL wire
#
# Lines starting with # are comments. Blank lines are ignored.
#
# Boot tune: tetris, mood, starwars, or random (default: random)
# boot_tune  random
#
# --- Direct GPIO sensors ---
gpio  16  C4
gpio  17  E4
#
# --- TCA9548A hub sensors (uncomment when hub connected) ---
# 0x70  0  A  C4
# 0x70  0  B  E4
# 0x70  1  A  G4
# 0x70  1  B  C5
